- Ensures that students will not be able to enroll for an exam if they have already been enrolled.
- Ensures that students will not be able to register for a subject if they have already been registered.
- Handles common errors and returns appropriate HTTP codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 409 for conflicts).
- Unit tests with **MockMvc** and **Mockito**.
